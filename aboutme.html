<p>	My name is Emmett Schillinger and I am in the class of 2025 at Wesleyan University. I am from a small town north of Boston, Marblehead, where I have lived my whole life. At Wesleyan University I am associated with a variety of extracurriculars and groups. When not doing schoolwork, I create artwork, make music, or develop my athleticism. I am on the lacrosse team here at Wesleyan University. At school my main focus of study is computer science. I also take some courses in both education and art departments. Education is something that is very interesting to me and I am hoping to one day become a teacher. It would be a great fun experience to work with students especially in a creative topic like art or music. Upon graduation, I am planning to pursue coding related work. I have a passion for coding and find it fun and challenging. My goal is to take advantage of my creativity and have a positive impact on as many people as possible.
